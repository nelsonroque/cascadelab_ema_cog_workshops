## Intentions of this Workshop

  - To train the next-generation of scientists to work with data - regardless of the type, format, or volume.
  - Make available a set of open-source materials to learn how to engage in reproducible science, leveraging code-based techniques.
  - This repository is intended to house various sample workflows, and code snippets, to support research + data science activities.

## Background

***Workshop Overview:*** This workshop is designed to provide a comprehensive overview and practical skills in the application of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) within cognition research. EMA is a valuable research tool that captures real-time data on individuals' cognitive states and processes in their natural environments. This workshop will guide participants through the lifecycle of an EMA cognition research project, from conceptualization to data analysis and dissemination of findings. Our aim is to empower researchers with the knowledge and tools necessary to effectively implement EMA methodologies in their work, enhancing the ecological validity and impact of their research on cognition.
