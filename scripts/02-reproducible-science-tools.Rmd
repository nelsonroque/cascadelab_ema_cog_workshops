# Reproducible Science Tools & Platforms

## Overview

Reproducible Science is supported by a large toolkit of software. Below is a highlight of a few important tools that meet most data needs.

## What is Github?

A platform to store and collaborate on code.

[Get Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Github Concepts

- `Repository`: a logical unit of storage for maintaining code/other assets. Can contain many folders, files.
- `.gitignore`: a file (with dot prefix) to specify what files should NOT be pushed to Github
- `.gitkeep`: a file (with dot prefix) to specify that a folder should be kept if blank as part of the project structure. This is helpful when creating templates.
- `commit`: create a record/snapshot of all files (or specific files) at a moment in time. You may tag collaborators, add a title and notes.
- `push`: 'storing' the result of prior commits
- `pull`: 'extracting' the result of prior commits
- `diff`: difference (line-specific) between two commits. Helpful when trying to remember when and where code edits where made.

## What is Markdown?

Lightweight markup used to add formatting elements to plaintext documents.

Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the worldâ€™s most popular markup languages.

- Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor.
- In Word, you click buttons in GUI to apply formatting
- In Markdown, you add syntax to text to apply formatting

## What is R?

Statistical programming language (released ~1993). Similar to `S` (released ~1976).

Download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

### What is RStudio?

Integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

Download [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

### What is RMarkdown?

Reproducible notebook (akin to Jupyter Notebooks in Python) where you can write a narrative using Markdown syntax and embed code/plots throughout.

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, MS Word and Powerpoint documents, websites and more. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

This is an R Markdown-based book, using the `bookdown` package. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

### What are R packages?

Think of CRAN as an equivalent to iOS App Store, or Google Play Store; CRAN is where you download published R packages (directly from R, RStudio).

A developer can also make packages available directly in source code, or via tools like Github, for example:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nelsonroque/ruf")
```

## What is Endnote

A citation manager. Especially useful for research projects with large amounts of citations.

Here is a [guide from the UCF library with installation links](https://guides.ucf.edu/citations-endnote).

### Why Endnote?
- no need for manual tracking (deleting, updating) of references
- change citation format at click of a button
- capture PDFs for any citations at click of a button

### Endnote Downloads:
- [Mac](http://ezproxy.library.ucf.edu/loggedin/EndNote20SiteInstaller.zip)
- [Windows](http://ezproxy.library.ucf.edu/loggedin/EndNote20.zip)
